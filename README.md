# Ayari - Static website hosting software with Dropbox

## Description

Ayari is a simple HTTP server which hosts a static website.

Since it uses Dropbox as the backend, you can deploy your website by just adding some files to the application folder in your Dropbox directory.

## Requirements

- Dropbox Access Token
- Ruby 2.4.0 (may work < 2.4.0 but not guaranteed)

In order to get the access token, you should create your own Dropbox application via [https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps/create](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps/create) and generate your personal access token at the application setting page.
